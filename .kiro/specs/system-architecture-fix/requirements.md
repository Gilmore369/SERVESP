# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ServesPlatform system currently has critical architectural issues that prevent proper functionality and database connectivity. The system consists of a Google Apps Script backend that serves as an API layer connected to Google Sheets as a database, and a Next.js frontend application. Multiple issues exist across both components that need systematic resolution to create a functional, maintainable, and scalable platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Google Apps Script Backend Consolidation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a single, clean, and functional Google Apps Script backend, so that the API can reliably serve data without conflicts or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple Google Apps Script files exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, optimized version
2. WHEN the backend receives API requests THEN it SHALL respond with consistent JSON format and proper error handling
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use Google Apps Script Properties Service instead of hardcoded values
4. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL be lightweight and not impact performance
5. WHEN CRUD operations are performed THEN they SHALL work reliably with proper validation and error responses

### Requirement 2: Database Schema Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured and validated database schema in Google Sheets, so that data integrity is maintained and CRUD operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is set up THEN it SHALL have consistent column names and data types across all sheets
2. WHEN data validation is applied THEN it SHALL prevent invalid data entry and maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN sheets are created THEN they SHALL follow a standardized naming convention and structure
4. WHEN relationships exist between entities THEN they SHALL be properly defined and enforced
5. WHEN sample data is provided THEN it SHALL be realistic and useful for testing

### Requirement 3: Frontend Architecture Simplification

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a simplified and maintainable frontend architecture, so that I can easily develop features without getting lost in over-engineered abstractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use a single, simple API client without multiple abstraction layers
2. WHEN components are developed THEN they SHALL follow a clear and consistent pattern without unnecessary complexity
3. WHEN state management is needed THEN it SHALL use simple, built-in React patterns rather than complex custom solutions
4. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL be simple and effective without over-engineering
5. WHEN error handling is needed THEN it SHALL be straightforward and user-friendly

### Requirement 4: API Integration Reliability

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to reliably connect to the backend and display data, so that I can use the platform effectively for my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN they SHALL consistently reach the Google Apps Script backend
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL work reliably with proper session management
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL be displayed correctly in the user interface
4. WHEN CRUD operations are performed THEN they SHALL update the database and reflect changes in the UI
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with meaningful user feedback

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to load quickly and respond promptly to my actions, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display the main interface within 3 seconds
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions
3. WHEN large datasets are handled THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination and loading states
4. WHEN the application is used THEN it SHALL maintain responsive performance throughout the session
5. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL improve performance without causing data staleness issues

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, well-documented, and maintainable code, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow consistent coding standards and best practices
2. WHEN functions are created THEN they SHALL have clear names, proper documentation, and single responsibilities
3. WHEN files are organized THEN they SHALL follow a logical structure that makes the codebase easy to navigate
4. WHEN dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be necessary, up-to-date, and properly managed
5. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be centralized and environment-specific

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive but efficient error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues without impacting system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught, logged appropriately, and handled gracefully
2. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL provide useful information without overwhelming the system
3. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL receive clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the logs SHALL provide sufficient information to identify and resolve issues
5. WHEN the system is in production THEN logging SHALL be optimized for performance and storage efficiency

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the system works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is tested THEN it SHALL have unit tests for all critical functions
2. WHEN the frontend is tested THEN it SHALL have component tests and integration tests
3. WHEN API integration is tested THEN it SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
4. WHEN data validation is tested THEN it SHALL ensure business rules are properly enforced
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL pass all automated tests and quality checks
